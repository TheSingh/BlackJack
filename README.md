# BlackJack
A fully functional BlackJack simulator with a built-in dealer, written entirely in C++ and following Object Oriented Philosophy.

This is just something quick I made in a couple of free hours of winter break, when I was trying to get better at blackjack.. I thought hmmm.. I wonder if I could construct the game in C++.

Potential upcoming features:
        GUI implementation of the game
